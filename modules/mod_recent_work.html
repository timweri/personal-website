            <p>Hi! My name is Thanh. I am studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo with outstanding academic standing in every term.</p>
            <p>I am a Junior Developer/Software Engineer with considerable experience in the computer industry. Through various personal and commercial projects, I am skilled in Python, C++ and the common Web Development Stack (HTML/<wbr>CSS/<wbr>JQuery/<wbr>Bootstrap/<wbr>JavaScript/<wbr>SASS). Being naturally persevering and a quick learner, I also have experience with many other tools and frameworks, including Git, OpenCL, Flask and Android Development (Java/<wbr>Android Studio).</p>
            <p>I am always excited to explore and experiment. Check out what I have built below!</p>
